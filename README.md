PrintingCode
============
This is a collection of assignments for [Printing Code](http://www.runemadsen.com/printing-code-2012), a class taught by [Rune Madsen](http://runemadsen.com/) at [NYU ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu) during Fall 2012.

These are just the processing templates I've been using to start my designs, in case someone wants to try them.

Print 01: Hello World
---------------------
First Assignment: Bring to class a design of an ice cream cone, in black and white and using only triangle, rect and ellipse. Yes, an ice cream cone.

Stylish ice-cream or olympic torch?

Print 03: Color
---------------
Assignment: create an abstract representation of your identity. This is an exercise in writing code that is generative, but within constraints.

Print 04: Typography
--------------------
Assignment: Pick a word and make a typeface around it. The important thing is that you draw the letters using some kind of rule-based logic.

Concentric: an algorithmic typeface made out of 3 concentric circles with variable weight and spacing. There's also a [video here](https://vimeo.com/50795127).

Print 05: Grids
---------------
Assignment: Create your own grid system and use it in a Processing sketch that outputs a poster with elements placed via a grid system.

I designed a generative book cover for The Lord of the Flies. A different print for every reader.

Print 06: Logo
--------------
Assignment: Write a sketch that outputs a logo for a specific entity, that being a person, group, company, etc. The logo needs to be organic, which means that it has some sort of dynamic expressions.

I started designing a generative logo for Miami Heat, which would become the basis for my final project.

Print 07: Vectors and Randomization
-----------------------------------
Assignment: Pick one of the famous [Olivetti posters by Giovanni Pintori](https://www.google.com/search?q=giovanni+pintori+olivetti&sugexp=chrome,mod%3D12&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&authuser=0&ei=DpjHUN39Gafy0QH63IGgCw&biw=1273&bih=753&sei=EJjHUJP0I5Dq0QHL94DYDA) and write a sketch that directly copies or is inspired by the design of the poster. You must demonstrate the use of weighted randomness and vectors.

My design: classic videogame consoles paying homage to Olivetti typewriters and Pintori.

Print 08: Repetition
--------------------
Assignment: Write a Processing sketch that generates a pattern for the company Makerbot, which should be designed to be used for their christmas gift wrapping paper.

I tried to create a recursive pattern with very few lines of code, that would allow for significant changes by only tweaking a couple parameters. Not sure how it fits Makerbot though...
